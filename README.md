Abstractâ€” Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play turn-based space fantasy RPG (Role-Playing Game) developed and published by Hoyoverse on April 26, 2023. Some of the main features of Honkai: Star Rail include collecting and upgrading characters and their equipment to successfully engage and win in a fight with some enemies. To get new characters, players must go through a gacha system called Warp that requires an in-game currency called Stellar Jades. Similarly, players need some other types of resources to upgrade their characters and equipment. One way of obtaining said resources is to solve puzzles that are available on many parts of the map. One of the available puzzles in Honkai: Star Rail is The Navigation Compass Puzzle. This paper investigates the mathematical model of variations of the navigation compass puzzle using number theory, develops some simple solvability checks, and develops a solver program for a variation of the puzzle. The findings reveal that certain variations of the puzzle are always solvable, while others are unsolvable or not yet determined.
